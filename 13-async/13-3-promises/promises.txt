A Promise is an javascript object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
A Promise is a way of promising a value that you may not have at the moment, and we attach callbacks to that object.
A Promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

A Promise always has 2 parameters: resolve and reject, and they are actually functions and at any point in the Promise if we call them, the Promise will be resolved or rejected.
If we don't resolve or reject a Promise, its status or its value will be "pending".

- every Promise has a .then() method and this method will run if our Promise is resolved and another one called .catch(), which will run if the Promise is rejected
