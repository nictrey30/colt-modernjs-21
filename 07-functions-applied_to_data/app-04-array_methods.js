// array FIND
// returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies th provided testing function
// The value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, undefined is returned.

// If you need the index of the found element in the array, use findIndex().
// If you need to find the index of a value, use Array.prototype.indexOf(). (Itâ€™s similar to findIndex(), but checks each element for equality with the value instead of using a testing function.)
// If you need to find if a value exists in an array, use Array.prototype.includes(). Again, it checks each element for equality with the value instead of using a testing function.
// If you need to find if any element satisfies the provided testing function, use Array.prototype.some().

// The indexOf() method returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at fromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.
